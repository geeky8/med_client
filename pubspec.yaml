  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    # - family: SFProText
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/SFProText-Bold.otf
    #     - asset: fonts/SFProText-Medium.otf
    #     - asset: fonts/SFProText-Regular.otf
    # - family: Roboto
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Black.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto-Thin.ttf
    # - family: Montserrat
